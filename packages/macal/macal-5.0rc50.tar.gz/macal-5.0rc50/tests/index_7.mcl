/*

This is to test a specific problem with indexed variables.
It has to do how it works in the VM.
In the VM i set the index inside the variable itself.
At some point it needs to be removed.
However, in some cases it must not be removed.

*/


/* 
    This first test is to see if the index is removed when the variable was used.
    Currently it is not removed, causing the variable to be printed as a single integer, 
    when it should be an array.

    This second test is to see if we can update a single element in the list, by adding 37 to its value.
    This interacts with the first test, because we fixed this one, causing the first test to fail.
