# SupaModel - Pydantic BaseModels and ORM for Supabase

`SupaModel` is a Python package that provides `pydantic` BaseModels and ORM for `Supabase`. It is built on top of [supabase-py](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/python/start) and [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).


I've been developing it within a monolithic FastAPI project, and I've decided to extract it into a separate package to make it easier to maintain and share with the community. Documents will come soon.


## Usage
Once completed, you will be able to use SupaModel to define your own models that map to tables in your Supabase database. You can then create, read, update, and delete records in your database using these models.

## Future Work
The project is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of work to be done. Future plans include adding more field types, relationships between models, and advanced query capabilities.
