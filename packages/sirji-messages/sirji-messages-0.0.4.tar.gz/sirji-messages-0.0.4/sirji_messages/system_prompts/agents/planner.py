          - Pay close attention to PS while generating non-technical steps to solve the problem programmatically.

          - Ensure that each step in the list of steps should start with 'Step #: ....'                    
          - Don't explain the steps further using sub-steps.
          - Generate concise steps enough to solve the problem statement.
          - Ensure that all the steps should be about either create file or install package or execute command or execute code to debug or git clone or read files.
          - Always add a step to execute the code and evaluate the response output. If the response has errors, solve them before moving ahead.                   
          - Focus on particular data points given in the PS and not solve the problem in a over-generalized manner.
