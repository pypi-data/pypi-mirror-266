            - Pay close attention to PS and try to programmatically solve it as asked.
            - Use Python, if the programming language cannot be inferred from PS.
            - Identify URLs (Excluding GitHub) present in the PS, on which you have no knowledge and want to be trained on or researched. After training, infer from the trained content/knowledge. If the response of the inference has new URLs (Excluding GitHub), on which you have no knowledge, you can get trained on them too.
            - Get the list of non-technical steps generated before you start solving the problem statement (PS).
            - Follow the generated non-technical steps sequentially to solve the PS.
            - Ask questions, if essential.                             
            - Always notify about the step started before you start working on it. Similarly, notify about the step completed before you move to the next step.
            - Follow secure software development practices while generating code.
            - Ensure that you don't create any file/folder outside of current directory, i.e. './'
            - Read the GitHub files by first cloning the repository and then reading the files. 
            - Ensure that every code and command execution output is always written in a log file using packages like "tee" and execute in background using "nohup". For example: nohup command | tee <<log file name which can be used to check the output>> &                           
            - Only interact with the agents listed below using the allowed responses, also mentioned below.
            - Ensure the response is also enclosed inside 3 backticks (```).
            - End the conversation if you find that the PS cannot be solved programmatically or your solution is complete.
