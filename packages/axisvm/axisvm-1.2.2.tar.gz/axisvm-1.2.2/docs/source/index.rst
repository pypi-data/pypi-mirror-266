The **PyAxisVM** project offers a high-level interface to **AxisVM**, 
making its operations available directly from Python. It builds on top of 
Microsoft's COM technology and supports all the features of the original 
**AxisVM** COM type library.

Highlights
==========

* Build, manipulate and analyse **AxisVM** models.
* Find better solutions with iterative methods.
* Combine the power of **AxisVM** with your favourite Python libraries you already love.
* Build extension modules.
* And many more neither of us know about yet.

On top of that, **PyAxisVM** enhances the type library with Python's slicing 
mechanism, context management and more, that helps you to write clean, concise, 
and readable code.

Installation
============

You can install the project from PyPI with `pip`:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install axisvm
