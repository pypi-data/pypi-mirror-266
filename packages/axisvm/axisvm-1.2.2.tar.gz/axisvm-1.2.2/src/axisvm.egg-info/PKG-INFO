## Overview

The **PyAxisVM** project offers a high-level interface to **AxisVM**, making its operations available directly from Python. It builds on top of Microsoft's COM technology and supports all the features of the original **AxisVM** COM type library, making you able to
  
* build, manipulate and analyse **AxisVM** models

* find better solutions with iterative methods

* combine the power of **AxisVM** with third-party Python libraries

* build extension modules

On top of that, **PyAxisVM** enhances the type library with Python's slicing mechanism, context management and more, that enables writing clean, concise, and readable code.

## Installation

This is optional, but we suggest you to create a dedicated virtual enviroment at all times to avoid conflicts with your other projects. Create a folder, open a command shell in that folder and use the following command

```console
>>> python -m venv venv_name
```

Once the enviroment is created, activate it via typing

```console
>>> .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

The **AxisVM** python package can be installed (either in a virtual enviroment or globally) from PyPI using `pip` on Python >= 3.7 <= 3.10:

```console
>>> pip install axisvm
```

or chechkout with the following command over HTTPS via <https://github.com/AxisVM/pyaxisvm.git> or by using the GitHub CLI

```console
gh repo clone AxisVM/pyaxisvm
```

and install from source by typing

```console
>>> pip install .
```

If you want to run the tests, you can install the package along with the necessary optional dependencies like this

```console
>>> pip install ".[test]"
```

### Development mode

If you are a developer and want to install the library in development mode, the suggested way is by using this command:

```console
>>> pip install "-e .[test, dev]"
```

If you plan to touch the docs, you can install the requirements for that as well:

```console
>>> pip install "-e .[test, dev, docs]"
```
