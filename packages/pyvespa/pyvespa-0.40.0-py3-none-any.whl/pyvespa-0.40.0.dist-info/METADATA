[Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) is the scalable open-sourced serving engine that enables users to store,
compute and rank big data at user serving time.
`pyvespa` provides a python API to Vespa.
It allows users to create, modify, deploy and interact with running Vespa instances.
The main goal of the library is to allow for faster prototyping and get familiar with Vespa features.

### Release instructions
* Check out master branch
* Temporarily change library version number in `get_target_version()` in [setup.py](setup.py) to the new version,
  e.g. "0.16.0".
* Run from the pyvespa root directory to create the library files:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install twine wheel

python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
``` 

With write access to [pypi.org/project/pyvespa/](https://pypi.org/project/pyvespa/),
upload, this requires username "__token__" and the token value as password, including the pypi- prefix:

```
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

At this point, the package has been released.
