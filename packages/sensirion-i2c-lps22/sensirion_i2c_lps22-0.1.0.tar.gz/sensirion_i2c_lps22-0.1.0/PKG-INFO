        ## Contributing
        
        We develop and test this driver using our company internal tools (version
        control, continuous integration, code review etc.) and automatically
        synchronize the `master` branch with GitHub. But this doesn't mean that we
        don't respond to issues or don't accept pull requests on GitHub. In fact,
        you're very welcome to open issues or create pull requests :-)
        
        ### Check coding style
        
        The coding style can be checked with [`flake8`](http://flake8.pycqa.org/):
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[test]  # Install requirements
        flake8                  # Run style check
        ```
        
        In addition, we check the formatting of files with
        [`editorconfig-checker`](https://editorconfig-checker.github.io/):
        
        ```bash
        pip install editorconfig-checker==2.0.3   # Install requirements
        editorconfig-checker                      # Run check
        ```
