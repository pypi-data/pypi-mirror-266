# CheckSources

CheckSources is a preprocessor that checks the projectâ€™s `chapters` for missing and unmentioned files in the sources directory.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install foliantcontrib.checksources
```

## Usage

To enable the preprocessor, add `checksources` to `preprocessors` section in the project config:

```yaml
preprocessors:
    - checksources
```

You can add a list of unmentioned files that wouldn't throw warnings by `not_in_chapters` option.
To perform a strict check, use the `strict_check` option:

```yaml
preprocessors:
    - checksources:
        not_in_chapters:
          - tags.md
        strict_check: true
```

The `not_in_chapters` option is useful if you don't need to add some files to the table of contents.

If the `strict_check` option is enabled, then if a critical error is detected, the build will be aborted after applying the preprocessor.
