Extensions require C++17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matplotlib now requires a compiler that supports C++17 in order to build its extensions.
According to `SciPy's analysis
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/toolchain.html#c-language-standards>`_, this
should be available on all supported platforms.
