ScalarMappables auto-scale their norm when an array is set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collections previously deferred auto-scaling of the norm until draw time.
This has been changed to scale the norm whenever the first array is set
to align with the docstring and reduce unexpected behavior when
accessing the norm before drawing.
