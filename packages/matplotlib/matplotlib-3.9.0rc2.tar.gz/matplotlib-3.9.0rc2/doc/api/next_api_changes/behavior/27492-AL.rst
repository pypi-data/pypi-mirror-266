Image path semantics of toolmanager-based tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, MEP22 ("toolmanager-based") Tools would try to load their icon
(``tool.image``) relative to the current working directory, or, as a fallback,
from Matplotlib's own image directory.  Because both approaches are problematic
for third-party tools (the end-user may change the current working directory
at any time, and third-parties cannot add new icons in Matplotlib's image
directory), this behavior is deprecated; instead, ``tool.image`` is now
interpreted relative to the directory containing the source file where the
``Tool.image`` class attribute is defined.  (Defining ``tool.image`` as an
absolute path also works and is compatible with both the old and the new
semantics.)
