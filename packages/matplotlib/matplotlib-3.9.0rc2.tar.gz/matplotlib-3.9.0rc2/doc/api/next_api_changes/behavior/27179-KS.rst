Default behavior of ``hexbin`` with *C* provided requires at least 1 point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior changed in 3.8.0 to be inclusive of *mincnt*. However that resulted in
errors or warnings with some reduction functions, so now the default is to require at
least 1 point to call the reduction function. This effectively restores the default
behavior to match that of Matplotlib 3.7 and before.
