Correctly treat pan/zoom events of overlapping Axes
---------------------------------------------------

The forwarding of pan/zoom events is now determined by the visibility of the
background-patch (e.g. ``ax.patch.get_visible()``) and by the ``zorder`` of the axes.

- Axes with a visible patch capture the event and do not pass it on to axes below.
  Only the Axes with the highest ``zorder`` that contains the event is triggered
  (if there are multiple Axes with the same ``zorder``, the last added Axes counts)
- Axes with an invisible patch are also invisible to events and they are passed on to the axes below.

To override the default behavior and explicitly set whether an Axes
should forward navigation events, use `.Axes.set_forward_navigation_events`.
