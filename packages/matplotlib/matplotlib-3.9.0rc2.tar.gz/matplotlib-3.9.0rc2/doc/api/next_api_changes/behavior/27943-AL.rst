plot() shorthand format interprets "Cn" (n>9) as a color-cycle color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, ``plot(..., "-C11")`` would be interpreted as requesting a plot
using linestyle "-", color "C1" (color #1 of the color cycle), and marker "1"
("tri-down").  It is now interpreted as requesting linestyle "-" and color
"C11" (color #11 of the color cycle).

It is recommended to pass ambiguous markers (such as "1") explicitly using the
*marker* keyword argument.  If the shorthand form is desired, such markers can
also be unambiguously set by putting them *before* the color string.
