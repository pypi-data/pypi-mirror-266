Legend labels for ``plot``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously if a sequence was passed to the *label* parameter of `~.Axes.plot` when
plotting a single dataset, the sequence was automatically cast to string for the legend
label.  Now, if the sequence has only one element, that element will be the legend
label.  To keep the old behavior, cast the sequence to string before passing.
