PowerNorm no longer clips values below vmin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When ``clip=False`` is set (the default) on `~matplotlib.colors.PowerNorm`,
values below ``vmin`` are now linearly normalised. Previously they were clipped
to zero. This fixes issues with the display of colorbars associated with a power norm.
