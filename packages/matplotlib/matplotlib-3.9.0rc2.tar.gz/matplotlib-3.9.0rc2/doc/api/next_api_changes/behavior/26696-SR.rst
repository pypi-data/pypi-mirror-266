*loc* parameter of ``Cell`` doesn't accept ``None`` anymore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default value of the *loc* parameter has been changed from ``None`` to ``right``,
which already was the default location. The behavior of `.Cell` didn't change when
called without an explicit *loc* parameter.
