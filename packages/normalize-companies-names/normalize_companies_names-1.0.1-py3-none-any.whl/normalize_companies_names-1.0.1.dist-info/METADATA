# Library to add a normalized companies names column in Excel file


### About the problem:
Once we find misspelling and not normalized companies names in an Excel file that contains the at least the column named **organization** we will struggle against the possibility of save and process data without integrity. This library aims to process the Excel file and add a new column named **canonical_name**.
