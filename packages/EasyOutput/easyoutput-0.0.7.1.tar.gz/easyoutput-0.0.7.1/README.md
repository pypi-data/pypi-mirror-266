# Easy Output 
```py 
# How to use ðŸ‘½
from EasyOutput.EasyOutput import *
```
# Information
**EasyOutput** consists of easy colored print options without the hassle of doing
```py
print(f"{Fore.GREEN + Style.BRIGHT}Success{Style.RESET_ALL}: Your Message")
```

In reality this is nothing special and just simply for my lazy use. You could easily make these yourself by doing
```py
def Success(message):
    print(f"{Fore.GREEN + Style.BRIGHT}Success{Style.RESET_ALL}: {message}")

# and calling it like so

Success("Your Success Message")
```

If you would rather save time instead, you can always download it by entering **pip install EasyOutput** into your terminal!\
Feel free to use this in any way you like, all I ask is that you show me your project when finished! ðŸ˜„
