# Automatically Assigning Industry Classifications to Company Descriptions â€“ An Entailment Based Approach

## Description
naicskit is a Python package which assigns industry classification codes to descriptions of companies. This model leverages the Huggingface library and an entailment-based approach for assigning taxonomy codes with the hopes that this will make the model robust with unseen taxonomies. Based on initial results, the model has an 87% accuracy on taxonomies it was trained on and 81% accuracy on unseen taxonomies.

## How To Use naicskit
```{python}
from naicskit.coder import IndustryCoder
description = '...'
coder = IndustryCoder('naics.2022','2')
results = coder.code_records(description)
```
