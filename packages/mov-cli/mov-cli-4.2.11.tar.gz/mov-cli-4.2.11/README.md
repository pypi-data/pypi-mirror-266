> v4 is constantly changing so be sure to keep the tool up to date and with that said I would advise not using it as a library yet.

## Installation 🛠️

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth installation instructions hit the [wiki](https://github.com/mov-cli/mov-cli/wiki/Installation).

### Prerequisites
- **A supported platform:**
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - Android (via [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/))
  - iOS (via [iSH Shell](https://ish.app/))
  - MacOS
- **[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** (**required**, with pip)
- **[lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)** (optional, ⚡ faster scraping)
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)** (optional but **highly recommended**)
- **[mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/)** (recommended & default media player)

To get running these are all the prerequisites you'll need.

With the prerequisites installed, mov-cli can be installed via the pip command on all platforms with Python version 3.8 or above.

```sh
pip install mov-cli -U
```
> Check out the [wiki on installation](https://github.com/mov-cli/mov-cli/wiki/Installation) for more in-depth guidance on installing mov-cli.

## Usage 🖱️
mov-cli comes packaged with a CLI interface via the `mov-cli` command you can use in your respective terminal. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may notice mov-cli doesn't ship with any scrapers (or previously known as providers) by default, this is because v4 is plugin-based and scrapers are now part of plugins that must be chosen to be installed.
> Find out how to do so at the [wiki](https://github.com/mov-cli/mov-cli/wiki#plugins).

1. Install the scraper plugin of your choice. Visit this [wiki page](https://github.com/mov-cli/mov-cli/wiki/Plugins) on how to do so and the [mov-cli-plugin](https://github.com/topics/mov-cli-plugin) topic for a list of **third-party** mov-cli plugins.
```sh
mov-cli -e
```
Alternatively, you may also edit by manually opening the config file. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mov-cli/mov-cli/wiki/Configuration#introduction).  
```toml
[mov-cli.plugins]
films = "package_name"
```


2. Scraper away!
```sh
mov-cli -s films spider man no way home
```

> The above command should search for `spider man no way home` with the following scraper.
