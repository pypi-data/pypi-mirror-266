def collectionChain(
    repo: str, mode: str, parent: str, children: Iterable[str], doc: str | None, flatten: bool
) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """Get the collections whose names match an expression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo : `str`
        URI to the location of the repo or URI to a config file describing the
        repo and its location.
    mode : `str`
        Update mode for this chain. Options are:
        'redefine': Create or modify ``parent`` to be defined by the supplied
        ``children``.
        'remove': Modify existing chain to remove ``children`` from it.
        'prepend': Add the given ``children`` to the beginning of the chain.
        'extend': Modify existing chain to add ``children`` to the end of it.
        'pop': Pop a numbered element off the chain. Defaults to popping
        the first element (0). ``children`` must be integers if given.
        Both 'prepend' and 'extend' are the same as 'redefine' if the chain
        does not exist.
    parent : `str`
        Name of the chained collection to update. Will be created if it
        does not exist already.
    children : iterable of `str`
        Names of the children to be included in the chain.
    doc : `str`
        If the chained collection is being created, the documentation string
        that will be associated with it.
    flatten : `bool`
        If `True`, recursively flatten out any nested
        `~CollectionType.CHAINED` collections in ``children`` first.

    Returns
    -------
    chain : `tuple` of `str`
        The collections in the chain following this command.
