# What is PyserSSH

PyserSSH is a library for remote control your code with ssh client. The aim is to provide a scriptable SSH server which can be made to behave like any SSH-enabled device.

This Server use port **2222** for default port

# Quick Example
```py
import os

from PyserSSH import Server, Send, AccountManager

useraccount = AccountManager()
useraccount.add_account("admin", "") # create user without password

ssh = Server(useraccount)

@ssh.on_user("command")
def command(client, command: str):
    if command == "hello":
        Send(client, "world!")
        
ssh.run(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'private_key.pem'))
```
This example you can connect with `ssh admin@localhost -p 2222` and press enter on login
If you input `hello` the response is `world`

I intend to leaked private key because that key i generated new. I recommend to generate new key if you want to use on your host because that key is for demo only.
why i talk about this? because when i push private key into this repo in next 5 min++ i getting new email from GitGuardian. in that email say "
GitGuardian has detected the following RSA Private Key exposed within your GitHub account" i dont knows what is GitGuardian and i not install this app into my account.
