# overturemaps-py

Official Python command-line tool of the [Overture Maps Foundation](overturemaps.org)

Note: This repository and project are experimental. Things are likely change including the user interface
until a stable release, but we will keep the documentation here up-to-date.

## Basic Usage

Quick Overview:

```
$ overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -o boston.geojson -f geojson -t building
```

This command will download the building footprints in the specific bounding box
as GeoJSON and save to a file named "boston.geojson"

#### `download`
There is currently one option to the `overturemaps` utility, `download`.

The `download` command option can download Overture Maps data into a few different file formats and
from an optional bounding box. The data is streamed out as it is read and can handle arbitrarily
large bounding boxes or the entire datset.

Command-line options:
* `bbox` (optional): west, south, east, north longitude and latitude coordinates. When omitted the
entire dataset for the specified type will be downloaded
* `--output`/`-o` (optional): Location of output file. When omitted output will be written to stdout.
* `-f` (required: one of "geojson", "geojsonseq", "geoparquet"): output format
* `--type`/`-t` (required): The Overture map data type to be downloaded. Examples of types are `building`
for building footprints, `place` for POI places data, etc. Run `overturemaps download --help` for the
complete list of allowed types

## Installation

`pip install overturemaps`
