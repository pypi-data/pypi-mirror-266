üåä You've arrived at **Rio**, an easy to use framework for creating websites and
apps.

üêç Rio is based **entirely on Python**. You **won't need a single line of HTML, CSS, or
JavaScript** to create beautiful, modern apps.

[Tutorial](https://rio.dev/docs/tutorial-simple-dashboard/1-rio-setup) - [Examples](https://rio.dev/examples) - [Discord](https://discord.gg/7ejXaPwhyH) -  [docs](https://rio.dev/docs) - [Source Code](https://gitlab.com/team-rio/rio)

Rio brings React-style components to Python. Pull from a wealth of built-in
components and combine them to create your own custom components. Then combine
those into entire apps. Best of all, Rio apps can run both locally on your
machine and on the web.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Rio is available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip:

## Getting Started üéì

Rio comes with a very helpful command line utility to help you out. Create a new project in one short command:
