## What is pyPANTERA?

pyPANTERA[^1] is a Python package that provides a simple interface to obfuscate natural language text. It is designed to help developers and data scientists protect the privacy of their data by obfuscating sensitive information in natural language text. 

The package offers a combination of natural language processing and mathematical transformations to obfuscate natural language text. It replaces sensitive information in the text with semantically similar but obfuscated words, making it difficult for others to understand the original meaning of the text.

## How to use pyPANTERA?

pyPANTERA is designed to be easy to use. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pypantera
```

Once installed, you can use it in your Python code as follows:

```python
import pypantera
```

## What can pyPANTERA do?

Test package for natural language obfuscation.

```python

pantherTest()
```
