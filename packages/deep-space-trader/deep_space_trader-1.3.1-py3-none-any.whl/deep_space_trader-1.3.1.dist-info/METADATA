Introduction
============

The player starts off on a planet within a system of 8 randomly-generated planets.
Each planet has various raw materials available for trading (13 types of raw material in total),
all with prices that differ from planet to planet, and fluctuate over time. The goal of the game
is to make as much money as possible by buying and selling raw materials between planets.

The player has an item inventory for raw materials, with a fixed (but upgradeable) capacity.
Only items in the inventory can be bought or sold. The player also has a warehouse with unlimited
capacity. Items can be transferred between the item inventory and the warehouse, but only
a certain number of transfers between item inventory and warehouse can be made per day.

Travelling between planets always incurs a risk of encountering pirates, who may
kill the player or rob them of their money / raw materials. The greater the value that the
player is travelling with (combined value of player's money and items in the player's inventory,
but not the warehouse), the greater the chance of encountering pirates.

The player can use any earned money to buy "upgrades" from a store. Only a certain number of
store purchases can be made per day. Some of the upgrades
allow the player to:

* Destroy planets altogether and acquire all their raw materials
  (Destroying a planet incurs a risk that the planet may fight to resist, which may kill the player)

* Buy and upgrade a battle fleet, which increases chances of winning fights against pirates,
  and against planets that resist destruction

* Buy and upgrade a scout fleet, which allows the player to discover thousands of
  new planets

* Upgrade the player's inventory capacity, which increases the number of items that can
  be bought or sold at once.

* Increment the number of warehouse trips allowed per day

Complete Game Reference
=======================

This following section describes the functionality of all sections of all game windows
in detail. Each game window has its own section in this document, with further document subsections
for sections within the game window.

**Main window**
###############

This section describes the functionality of all sections on the main game window
(the largest window, which opens on game startup). Each section in the main game window
has its own section in this document.

**"Information" section**
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/information_section.png

This section describes the functionality of the "Information" section of the main game window.
The "Information" section stretches across the entire top of the main game window, and
shows useful information about the current state of the game.

* **"Current Planet"**: Shows the name of, and an image of, the current planet the player is on.
* **"Current Day"**: Shows the current day number, against the total number of days before the game ends.
* **"Money"**: Shows the amount of money currently held by the player.
* **"Purchases"**: Shows the number of store purchases made by the player so far on the current day, against
  the total number of store purchases allowed on the current day (see `"Store" window`_ for more information).
* **"Planets discovered"**: Shows the total number of planets that have been discovered by the player.
  This number includes planets that have not been visited by the player, and planets that have been
  destroyed by the player.
* **"Scout fleet level"**: Shows the current upgrade level of the players scout fleet, against the
  maximum possible upgrade level for the players scout fleet. (see `"Store" window`_ for more information
  about upgrading the scout fleet).
* **"Battle fleet"**: Shows the current upgrade level of the players battle fleet, against the
  maximum possible upgrade level for the players battle fleet. Also shows the chance (percentage) of
  the player winning a battle, based on current battle fleet upgrade level. (see `"Store" window`_ for more
  information about upgrading the battle fleet).

**Global buttons section**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/global_buttons_section.png

This section describes the functionality of the 3 large buttons at the top of the
main game window, directly underneath the "Information" section.

* **"Reset" button**: Aborts the current game and starts a new game (Warning: player will lose
  all progress in the current game. When clicked, this button will first show a prompt,
  asking the player to confirm that they want to reset the game).

* **"Go to store" button**: Opens the Store window. See `"Store" window`_ for more details.

* **"Go to next day" button**: Advances the current day by 1. Often, the next day is reached by
  travelling to another planet, but this button advances to the next day without travelling.

**"Planets" section**
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/planets_section.png

This section describes the functionality of the "Planets" section of the main game
window. The "Planets" section is used for travelling between planets, and allows the player
to select the planet they want to travel to. The "Planets" section is displayed in the middle
left area of the main game window.

* **"Travel..." button**: Causes the player to travel to the selected planet. The player can also
  travel to a planet by double-clicking on the planet name in the "Planets" section. Travelling
  to a planet costs 100 of the player's money, and advances the current day by 1. Travelling always
  incurs a risk of encountering a pirate fleet. When encountered, the player will be given the choice
  to fight or not. If the player chooses to fight, and wins, then the player can continue their journey
  unscathed. If the player chooses to fight, and loses, then the player will die, and the game will end.
  The chance of the player winning a fight against pirates is directly correlated to the upgrade level
  of the players battle fleet (See `"Store" window`_). If the player chooses not to fight, then they
  will not die, but the pirates will steal (almost) all of the players money, and all of the items
  stored on the players ship. Items stored in the warehouse cannot be touched by pirates.

* **"Travel to previous" button**: Causes the player to travel to the planet that they were on
  directly before the current planet. Travelling to a planet costs 100 of the player's money,
  and advances the current day by 1.

* **Planet display table**: shows a list of all planets available to the player. Consists of two
  columns: The rightmost column, labelled "visited?", shows "yes" or "no" indicating whether
  the player has travelled to the planet. The leftmost column, labelled "Planet", shows the
  name of the planet. The player can travel to a planet by double-clicking on the planet name
  within the planet display table.

  item to the current planet. When clicked, this button will open a new window that allows
  the player to select the quantity they wish to sell of the selected item (See `"Sell items" window`_).
  If the current planet does not already hold any of the selected item, then the player
  will be asked if they want to provide a free (small quantity) sample of the item.
  If the player does not provide a free sample, then the item cannot be sold to the current
  planet. If the player does provide a free sample, then the planet may or may not decide to
  begin trading in the selected item. Only one free sample of a given item may be given to
  the same planet in the same day.

* **"Sell all" button**: Allows the player to attempt to sell all items on the ship to
  the current planet. Only items that the current planet already holds will be sold
  (free samples can only be provided via the "Sell items" button).

* **"Add to warehouse" button**: Allows the player to move 1 or more of the selected item
  from their ship to the warehouse. Unlike the player's ship, the warehouse has infinite
  capacity, but only one move to/from the warehouse per day is allowed (i.e. one trip
  to the warehouse per day). Additional warehouse trips per day can be purchased from the Store
  (See `"Store" window`_ for more details about the store window).
  Clicking this button opens a new window that allows the player to select the quantity of
  the item they want to move to the warehouse (see `"Move to warehouse" window`_).

right area of the main game window.

* **"Retrieve items" button**: Allows the player to move 1 or more of the selected items
  from the warehouse to their ship. Only one move to/from the warehouse per day is allowed

**"Store" window**
##################

.. image:: images/store.png

This section describes the functionality of the "Store" window. The store window can be reached
by clicking the "Go to store" button in the `Global buttons section`_ of the main window. The
store window allows the player to exchange money for various upgrades and services. Only 4 store
purchases can be made per day, but this number is increased when the player reaches certain scores
(see `Score bonuses`_ for more information).

* **Increase item capacity**: Buying this item doubles the number of items that can be
  stored on the players ship. This item can be bought an unlimited number of times.

* **Scout expedition**: Buying this item allows the player to discover between 4-8 new planets,
  which will become available in the `"Planets" section`_. More planets can be discovered per
  scout expedition by purchasing the "Upgrade scout fleet" store item.

* **Planet destruction kit**: Buying this item allows the player to destroy one planet and obtain
  all of its materials. The planet will disappear from the `"Planets" section`_ and all materials
  held by the planet will be transferred to the player's warehouse. Opens a new window that allows
  the player to pick which planet they want to destroy, or optionally destroy all planets at once
  (except for the current planet) for a higher price. There is a small chance that a single planet may
  resist destruction and attempt to fight back. The higher number of planets being destroyed, the
  higher the chance of one planet resisting will be. The player must decide whether to fight, or leave
  the planet alone. If the player fights and loses, the player will die and the game will be over.
  If the player fights and wins, then planet destruction will continue normally. The chance of
  the player winning this fight depends on the player's battle fleet level.

* **Upgrade scout fleet**: Buying this item increases the number of planets than can be
  discovered on a single scout expedition. This item can be bought a maximum of 9 times,
  to upgrade the scout fleet through levels 1 to 10.

  * *Scout fleet level 10*: between 4 and 4096 new planets per scout expedition

* **Buy/upgrade battle fleet**: Buying this item for the first time gives the player a
  battle fleet, which increases the chances of the player winning battles against planets
  that resist destruction, or when being robbed while travelling between planets. Subsequent
  purchases of this item upgrade the battle fleet through levels 1-10.

  * *Battle fleet level 0 (no battle fleet)*: 1% chance of winning battles
