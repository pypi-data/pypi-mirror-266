====================
`cti-stix-validator`
====================
NOTE: This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository <https://www.oasis-
open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__. See the `Governance`_
section for more information.

The STIX Validator checks that STIX JSON content conforms to the
requirements specified in the STIX 2.1 specification. In addition to
checking conformance with the `JSON schemas <https://github.com/oasis-
open/cti-stix2-json-schemas>`_, the validator checks conformance with
requirements that cannot be specified in JSON schema, as well as with
established "best practices". This validator is non-normative; in
cases of conflict with the STIX 2.1 specification, the specification
takes precedence.

The STIX 2.1 specification contains two types of requirements:
mandatory "MUST" requirements, and recommended "SHOULD" best practice
requirements. The validator checks documents against the "MUST"
requirements using JSON schemas. Some of these mandatory requirements
cannot be implemented in JSON Schema, however, so the validator uses
Python functions to check them. The "SHOULD" requirements are all
checked by Python functions, and options may be used to ignore some or
all of these recommended "best practices."

The only exception to this is the mandatory requirement that an
object's 'type' be one of those defined by a STIX Object in the
specification. This rules out custom objects, so this check was made
optional.

The validator also color-codes its output to make it easier to tell at
a glance whether validation passed.

`Installation`
==============

The easiest way to install the STIX validator is with pip:

::

  $ pip install stix2-validator

`Usage`
=======

As A Script
-----------

The validator comes with a bundled script which you can use to
validate a JSON file containing STIX content:

::

  $ stix2_validator <stix_file.json>

As A Library
------------

You can also use this library to integrate STIX validation into your
own tools. You can validate a JSON file:

.. code:: python

  from stix2validator import validate_file, print_results

  results = validate_file("stix_file.json")
  print_results(results)

You can also validate a JSON string using ``validate_string()``, or a Python
dictionary representing a STIX object using ``validate_instance()``. For more
information, see the full documentation
`here <https://stix2-validator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_.

Governance
==========

This GitHub public repository ( `https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-
stix-validator <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-validator>`_ )
was `proposed <https://lists.oasis-
