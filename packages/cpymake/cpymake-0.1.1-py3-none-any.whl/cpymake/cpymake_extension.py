    Attributes
    ----------
    package_name : str
      The name of the package, in dotted notation
      i.e. outterpackage.innerpackage, that cmake describes, all
      extension modules are grouped together under the package if
      ``inplace`` is True and the global ``--inplace`` flag is set
      (in pyproject.toml etc); both default to True. Otherwise all extension
      modules are in the root of the project build.

    cmake_lists_root_dir : str,
      Absolute path to root CMakeLists.txt. This *MUST* be an absolute path as
      setuptools, pip and build use temp directories and so relative paths will fail.
      If using multiple CMakeExtension's, for
      example in order to have multiple extension modules in different
      packages ensure you use different CMakeLists.txt in different
      directories. This may change if it causes extra work however for
      now it seems acdeptable.

    targets: list[str] | None, default: None
      List of targets to build. If None (the default) then no targets are
      specified and camke --build is ran without the --target option.

    generator: str | None, default None
        generator to use when building. If None (the default) then camke isn't
        passed the -G flag and the default generator for the host system will
        be used.
