## Helpful initiatives

- This project started during SUSE's [Hack Week 23](https://hackweek.opensuse.org), where I had the time to participate [a project](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/23/projects/forklift-text-based-gui-utility-for-dealing-with-containers) to implement something like `ocui`.
- This project is clearly strongly inspired from [K9s](https://k9scli.io/). Without it I would probably never had found the inspiration for `ocui`.
- The endless nice TUI managers from the community, starting from `top` to `htop`, `glances` and all the others.
