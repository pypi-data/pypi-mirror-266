"""Collection of array or image manipulation functions.

If there are any functions which are done on arrays (or anything that is
just an array under the hood), we usually group it here. Moreover, functions
which would otherwise operate on images are also placed here. As images are
just arrays under the hood (and to avoid conflict with
/lezargus/container/image.py), image manipulation functions are kept here too.

Note that all of these functions follow the axes convention of indexing being
(x, y, lambda). If a cube is not of this shape, then it will likely return
erroneous results, but, the functions themselves cannot detect this.
