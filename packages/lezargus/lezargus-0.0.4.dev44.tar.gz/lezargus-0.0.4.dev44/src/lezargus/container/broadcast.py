    """Make a LezargusCube from a LezargusSpectra via uniform broadcasting.

    We make a LezargusCube, from a provided template, using uniform
    broadcasting. Uniform broadcasting is where all spectral slices, within
    the cube, are all the same for a uniform spatial distribution of the
    spectra, which is in this case the provided input spectra.

    In the case of both the input spectra and provided template cube having
    different wavelength arrays, we follow the provided mode to handle the
    different cases. The input template cube only provides the array shapes and
    the wavelength axis (dependant on the mode); the rest comes from the
    input spectra.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_spectra : LezargusSpectra
        The input spectra which will be broadcasted to fit the input template
        cube.
    template_cube : LezargusCube
        The template cube which will serve as a template to determine the
        dimensional properties of the resulting broadcasting cube.
    wavelength_mode : str, default = "error"
        The mode to handle possible wavelength array conflicts between the
        spectra and the cube. The available options are:

            - "spectra" : Prefer the spectra's wavelength array; the cube's
              wavelength is ignored.
            - "cube" : Prefer the cube's wavelength array; the spectra is
              interpolated to align to the new wavelength.
            - "error" : We log an error. We still attempt to figure it out,
              defaulting to the spectra's wavelength array.

    Returns
