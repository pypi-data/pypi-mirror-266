Default: "Specify a (short) list of very \"cheap\" indexes to be refreshed when metadata-only reindexing is requested, e.g. [getId].\nNOTE: This affects only operations which use this value explicitly, like the use of an updater which was created by collective.metadataversion.utils.make_metadata_updater."
