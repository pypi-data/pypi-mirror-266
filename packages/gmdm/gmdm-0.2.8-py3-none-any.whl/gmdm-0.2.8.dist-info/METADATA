# GmDm

A GameMaker Dependency Management system

## Installation

To install this project as a global Python package, you need to have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using `pip install gmdm`

Otherwise, you can create a virtual environment By following these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install the package using `pip install gmdm`

In the second way, you will have to activate the virtual environment every time you want to use `gmdm`

## Usage

Now that you have installed this package, you will have to set up the projects that do the imports (current project) to work with it.

For any GameMaker project to be compatible with GmDm, you don't have to create a `gmdm.yml` file inside each GameMaker project's folder.
This file is optional. It defines the yyp file name, optionally imports and exports, if any, of your GameMaker project(s).

It simply tells GmDm that this project imports a GameMaker "Folder" or Group of resources from other projects.
These other projects should be GmDm compatible.

Projects to be imported are looked up in multiple directories:

1. `${GMDM_IMPORT_DIRS}` env variable. Which is string of paths delimited by ;
2. Absolute path.
3. relative to current directory.
4. ~/Documents/GameMakerStudio2/Projects.


### Basic Usage

To make your project GmDm compatible at least it should have this content at minimum:

##### File: C:/path/to/My Project/My Project.yyp
##### File: C:/path/to/My Project/gmdm.yml
```yml
name: My Project.yyp

```

Another example where you define a project that is to be a dependency for other projects:
```yml
name: Core.yyp
exports:
  - Sprites/My Group
  - Objects/My Group
  - Scripts/My Group
```

Now to import the project's exports:

```yml
name: Second Project.yyp
imports:
    - path/to/core
```

Basically the same as:

```yml
name: Second Project.yyp
imports:
    - path/to/core:
      - Sprites/My Group
      - Objects/My Group
      - Scripts/My Group
```

For advance usage, you can see the file `gmdm.yml.EXAMPLE`.

Now you can use `gmdm sync`, or any of these commands when inside your project directory:

```bash
gmdm sync --fake    # displays operations without actually performing any. Useful for visualization of what will happen.
gmdm sync           # performs reimporting (newely modified assets from the imported projects)
```

To show the help, you can use the following command:

`gmdm --help`


## Advanced Usage

Consider using `to` in order to have the same path from multiple projects.

```yml
name: Project1.yyp
imports:
  - path/to/project2:
    - My Main Folder/My Folder:
      to: Extensions/My Project 2 Folder
  - ../project3:
    - My Main Folder/My Different Folder:
      to: Extensions/My Project 3 Folder
  - !ENV '${MY_DIR}/project5'

  - AWellKnownProject

```

## Notes

Do:

- Keep things simple. 
- Use this for your own local machine package management.
- Know what you are importing.

Do not:

- Do not import the same assets or folders that have the same assets from multiple projects.
- Do not import the same folder path from multiple projects. Use `to` in this case.

Other:

- Zombie files are kept.
- GmDm is intelligent enough to handle renamed imports when syncing.
- If a project does not have specific exports, it is thoroughly imported.
- If a project does not have a gmdm.yml file, it will still be able to be a dependency.
- For best usage, clone the repos of projects, that you want as dependencies, to a specific directory. Then use gmdm to import them. It is best to set up an environment variable `GMDM_IMPORT_DIRS=/d/Projects/;/e/GameMaker/`
