__doc__="""Module for defining trajectory splitting rules.
All rule functions must have the following signature:
    def rule_name(track: Track, *args, **kwargs) -> bool:
        ...
        
Rules must be defined such that they return True if the track is to be
rejected, and False if the track is to be accepted. 
        
To make a recipe for the TrajectorySplitter class, you are expected to
fix the rule function's arguments, such that only a one-argument function
remains. It is recommended to use the `functools.partial` function for this.
        
Once you have defined a set of rule functions, you can create a recipe
for the TrajectorySplitter class by passing them to the Recipe class.

Example:
    from functools import partial
    from pytsa.trajectories import rules
    
    # Define a recipe
    recipe = rules.Recipe(
        partial(rules.too_few_obs, n=100),
        partial(rules.too_small_span, span=0.1)
    )
    
    # Cook the recipe
    cooked = recipe.cook()
    
The `cooked` function can now be passed to the TrajectorySplitter class
to perform the trajectory splitting.
