# This class is a holder for all information regarding the processing
# of a handler, a handler is the function accountable of working on
# a image or binary data to create proper output.
#
# It's just a wrapper of a `success` a `text` or a `file` if the
# output of processor is a file.
#
# This information is used within the `notify` method (which receives a
# callback function) to report source of the translation of the
# issue.
