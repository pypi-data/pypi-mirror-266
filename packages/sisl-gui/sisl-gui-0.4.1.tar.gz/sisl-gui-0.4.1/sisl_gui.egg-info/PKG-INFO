Description: This is the graphical interface that you can use to interact with [sisl's](https://github.com/zerothi/sisl) visualization module.
        
        It consists of two parts:
        - [Back-end](sisl_gui): The backend is implemented in python. The most important part is the `Session` class which stores
        and manages the app state. The `Session` can be connected to the frontend either using pyodide (it runs directly on the browser)
        or through sockets (implemented with `flask` and `flask-socketio`).
        - [Front-end](frontend): A javascript/typescript UI, which is developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/). The build is
        shipped with the python package and also available at https://pfebrer.github.io/sisl-gui/.
