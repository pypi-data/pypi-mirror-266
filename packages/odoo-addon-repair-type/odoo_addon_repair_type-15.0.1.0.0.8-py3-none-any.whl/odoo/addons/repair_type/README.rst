This module adds the type to a repair order. If we select a type on a Repair Order, Odoo will automatically fill some fields of the order.

Configuration
=============

No configuration needed for this module.

Usage
=====

Go to Configuration>Repair Types and create a new repair type. Afterwards selecting a type on a Repair Order will automatically fill some fields.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Possible improvements for future versions:

* Destination Location of the product to repair is not used currently,
  so that's why is invisible. We still save the field for future new
  module implementations.
