# CellSNAP

Official implementation of Cell Spatial And Neighborhood Pattern (CellSNAP), a computational method that learns a single-cell representation embedding by integrating cross-domain information from tissue samples.
Through the analysis of datasets spanning spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we demonstrate CellSNAPâ€™s capability to elucidate biologically relevant cell populations that were previously elusive due to the relinquished tissue morphological information from images.

NOTE: this repository is under active development, and the current version is only meant for <ins>reviewing and early access testing etc</ins>. We will provide more detailed installation instruction and tutorial soon.
