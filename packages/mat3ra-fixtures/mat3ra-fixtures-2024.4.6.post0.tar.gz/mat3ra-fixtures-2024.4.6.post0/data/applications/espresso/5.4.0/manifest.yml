        Electronic band structure and density of states calculation for FCC Silicon. Has the following steps
            1. SCF calculation on a grid
            2. Non-self-consistent field (NSCF) calculation on a k-path for the electronic band structure
            3. Creation of the data for the plot of the bandstructre with bands.x
            4. NSCF calculation on a grid for the density of states
            5. Creation of the data for the plot of the bandstructre with projwfc.x
    executables:
      - pw.x
      - bands.x
      - projwfc.x
