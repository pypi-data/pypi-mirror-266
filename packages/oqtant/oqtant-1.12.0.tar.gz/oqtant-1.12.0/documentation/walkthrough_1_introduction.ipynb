    "Welcome to the `Oqtant python API`, aka `OqtAPI`, an object-oriented interface for creating, submitting, and retrieving results from experiments with ultracold quantum matter on Infleqtion's Oqtant Quantum Matter Services (QMS) platform.  In this introductory walkthrough, we will explore the basics of how you interact with Oqtant QMS using OqtAPI.  The general workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Oqtant account: [https://oqtant.infleqtion.com](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com)\n",
    "2. Download and install Oqtant: [https://pypi.org/project/oqtant/](https://pypi.org/project/oqtant/)\n",
    "3. Run this Jupyter Notebook to get started!\n",
    "4. Instantiate an instance of the `QuantumMatterFactory`, which facilitates communication with Oqtant QMS. This object handles authentication.\n",
    "5. Create a user-defined `QuantumMatter`, aka *matter*, object for making and/or manipulating quantum matter.  This is accomplished with the help of a `QuantumMatterFactory`.  This *factory* will serve as your \"one stop shop\" for creation of abstracted objects that control experiments carried out on the Oqtant hardware.\n",
    "6. Submit your *matter* object to Oqtant QMS.  This submits your job to Oqtant's hardware platform. Each *matter* object represents one job, and is identified by a `job id` (UUID or *id*). \n",
    "7. Use the *matter* object to check status of your job.\n",
    "8. When your job is complete, view and analyze results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, please refer to our documentation: [https://oqtant-docs.infleqtion.com](https://oqtant-docs.infleqtion.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "See our web application https://oqtant.infleqtion.com/ for quick access to job creation, results, and account management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Support, feature requests, and bug reports can be submitted here: [https://oqtant.infleqtion.com/support](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com/support)\n",
    "\n",
    "This, along with all our example notebooks are publicly available for download from our [GitLab repository.](https://gitlab.com/infleqtion/albert/oqtant-documentation/-/tree/main/oqtant_documentation/docs/examples?ref_type=heads)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough focuses on how to use OqtAPI with Oqtant QMS.  Follow-on walkthroughs will explore user options, accessible abstractions, and data structures in more detail."
