# RAWS

RAWS is a simple AWS Profile Manager with a command-line interface that helps you easily manipulate AWS profiles on your local machine.
RAWS will lookup location of your AWS credentials file through environment variable `AWS_CREDS_FILE`. If the variable is not set, it will default to `~/.aws/credentials`. You can also override the file location by specifing `--creds_file` argument.

## Installation

You can install the raws by cloning the repository and running pip install:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:andzhi4/raws
cd raws && pip install .
```

Using PyPi:
```shell
pip install rawscli
```

This will display a list of available commands:
`raws -h`

### Available commands

* `add`: Add a new AWS profile.
* `delete`: Delete an existing AWS profile.
* `list`: List all available AWS profiles.
* `show`: Show detailed information on specified profile
* `setdefault`: Make specified profile default
* `rename`: Rename a profile
* `backup`: backup credentials file (optionally provide location)
* `restore`: restore from a location or from latest backup
* `version`: show current version and exit


## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the AWS Profile Manager:

Show all available profiles:
```shell
raws list 
```
or
```shell

Add a new profile from clipboard (copied from AWS SSO page), set as default, rename to `personal`:

```

```
