## Typing stubs for docutils

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`docutils`](https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`docutils`.

This version of `types-docutils` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `docutils==0.20.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/docutils. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a9d644b3ffd9e9a8bb9a01393674972573cd256b` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.357, and
pytype 2024.3.19.
