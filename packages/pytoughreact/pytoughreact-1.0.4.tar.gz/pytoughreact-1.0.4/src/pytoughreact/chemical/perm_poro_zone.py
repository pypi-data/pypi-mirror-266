            Index for the permeability law.
            0: no change in permeability. Can be used to turn off permeability changes in specific
            zones
            1: simplified Carman-Kozeny (See user guide for more). The parameter values (a_param and
            b_param) are not used and may be set to 0.0 or any real number.
            2: Modified Hagen-Poiseulle Model. Permeability calculated from pore throat diameter,
            number of throats per pore, and number of pores per area using the Hagen-Poiseulle
            equation. The parameters are: a_param - number of effective throats per pore (typically
            about 2 to 3). b_param -  number of pores per m2 area
            3: cubic law (See user guide for more). The parameter values a_param and b_param are not used and may
            be set to 0.0 or any real number.
            4: modified Cubic Law (See user guide for more). The parameters are: a_param - fracture porosity /
            fracture-matrix area (analogous to fracture aperture) (m3/m2) and b_param - fracture spacing (m).
            5: Verma-Pruess permeability-porosity relation (See user guide for more). The parameters are: a_param - the
            value of “critical” porosity at which permeability goes to zero and b_param - a power law
            exponent.
