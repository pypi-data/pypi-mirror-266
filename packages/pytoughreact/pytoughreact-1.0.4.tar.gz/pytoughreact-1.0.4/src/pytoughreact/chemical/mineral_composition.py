        Parameters
        -----------
        mineral :  Mineral
            Mineral phase with all its properties,
        init_volume_fraction : float
            initial volume fraction of the mineral, excluding liquid (mineral volume divided by total volume
            of solids). The sum of VOL's need not add up to 1. If the sum is less than 1, the remaining solid
            volume fraction is considered nonreactive.
        reaction_type : int
            Flag for the mineral type ; 0 for minerals at equilibrium,  for minerals under kinetic constraints
            and 2 to suppress reaction for either kinetic and/or equilibrium minerals
        radius : float
            Radius of mineral grain (in m) used to calculate surface area
        reactive_surface_area : float
            Specific reactive surface area (See user guide for more)
        unit : int
            Flag to specify the units of input reactive_surface_area values. 0 for cm2mineral/gmineral,
            1 for m2mineral/m3mineral, 2 for m2rock/m3medium (total), 3 for m2rock/m3medium (solids),
            3 and radius=0, the input surface area will remain constant,
            4 (constant rate is input in mol/sec; surface area is not used)
