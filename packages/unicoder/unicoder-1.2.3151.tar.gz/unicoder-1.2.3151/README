The 'unicoder' PyPI package is deprecated, use 'text-unicoder' 
rather than 'unicoder' for pip commands.

Please replace 'unicoder' in your pip requirements (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg)
with 'text-unicoder'. For the next years this wrapper package continues to exist
which has a dependency on the new package name.
