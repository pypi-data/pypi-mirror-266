The 'unicoder' PyPI package is deprecated, use 'text_unicoder' rather than 'unicoder' for pip commands.

Please replace 'unicoder' in your pip requirements
(requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg) with 'text_unicoder'.
For the next years this wrapper package continues to exist
which has a dependency on the new package name.
