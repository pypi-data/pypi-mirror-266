After running, newly generated documentation shall be available at
`./docs/_build/html/`.

## Committing code

Please follow these guidelines when committing code for this project:

- Use a topic with a colon to start the subject
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Do not capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why (instead of how)

As an example:


    endpoints: support package attenuations

    Required in order to obtain credentials that apply only to a given package;
    be it charm, snap or bundle.
