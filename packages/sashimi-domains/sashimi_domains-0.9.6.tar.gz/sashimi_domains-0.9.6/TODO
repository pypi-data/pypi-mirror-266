# Issues

- [ ] Make sync and persist between doc historgam and topic histogram

- [ ] Update term counts to selected domain

- [ ] show total topic usage

- [ ] block talbes: tables for 'ext' also show terms

- [?] show some kind of +/- intensity bar for positive and negative characteristic blocks

## HBM

- [datatable] Show titles with extra columns in a sortable, filterable table

- [ ] Show specific to the left, common to the right (children are to the right)

- [ ] check for col_title, which crashes visualisations if unset, or provide alternative (first terms?)

- [ ] for a domain show network

- [ ] to color with nested measures

# Ideas

- [ ] Author migration as flux (more generally other metadata)

- [ ] Display time in sashimi's rectangles

- [master] Negative characteristics ("absences")

- [ ] Deep [sequential] hypergraph as DTM+ and else

- [ ] Sequential causes graphs SBM (G1 => G2) (can chaining help express this?)

- [Luis-Daniel] Transfer and collaborative learning

# Resolved

## HBM

- [x] for a domain show temporal profile of topics

- [x] zoom on selected

- [x] Fix normalization bug. I think I get it: normalization is based on sample while values are based on the full corpus because they're taken from the cache.
