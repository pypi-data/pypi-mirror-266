**Griptape** is a modular Python framework for building AI-powered applications that connect securely to your enterprise data and APIs. It offers developers the ability to maintain control and flexibility at every step.

**Build AI Apps**: Easily compose apps in Python with modular structures and ready-made tools. Use built-in drivers to connect to whichever LLMs and data stores you choose.

**Control Data Access**: Connect securely to data sources with granular access controls, ensuring LLMs stay focused on the information that matters.

**Scale With Your Workload**: Easily deploy and run apps in the cloud, where your data lives. Process data ahead of time or vectorize it on the fly.

Using Griptape, you can securely integrate with your internal data stores and APIs. You get to control what data goes into the prompt, and what the LLM is allowed to do with it. 

## Documentation

Please refer to [Griptape Docs](https://docs.griptape.ai/) for:

## Quick Start

First, install **griptape**:

```
pip install "griptape[all]" -U
```

Second, configure an OpenAI client by [getting an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and adding it to your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. By default, Griptape uses [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) to execute LLM prompts.

With Griptape, you can create *structures*, such as `Agents`, `Pipelines`, and `Workflows`, that are composed of different types of tasks. Let's build a simple creative agent that dynamically uses three tools and moves the data around in short-term memory.

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager, TaskMemoryClient

agent = Agent(
    input_template="Load {{ args[0] }}, summarize it, and store it in a file called {{ args[1] }}.",
    tools=[
        WebScraper(),
        FileManager(),
        TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=True)
    ]
)
agent.run("https://griptape.ai", "griptape.txt")
```

And here is the output:
```

```

During the run, the Griptape Agent loaded a webpage with a **Tool**, stored its full content in **Tool Memory**, queried it to answer the original question, and finally saved the answer to a file.

The important thing to note here is that no matter how big the webpage is it can never blow up the prompt token limit because the full content of the page never goes back to the LLM. Additionally, no data from the subsequent subtasks were returned back to the prompt either. So, how does it work?

All tools have the `off_prompt` property enabled be default. Disabling it (`off_prompt=False`) will force the framework to return all tool outputs directly to the LLM prompt. `TaskMemoryClient` requires the user to set this property explicitly for usability reasons. In the above example, we set `off_prompt` to `True`, which means that the LLM can never see the data it manipulates, but can send it to other tools.

[Check out our docs](https://docs.griptape.ai/latest/griptape-framework/structures/prompt-drivers/) to learn more about how to use Griptape with other LLM providers like Anthropic, Claude, Hugging Face, and Azure.

## Versioning

Griptape is in constant development and its APIs and documentation are subject to change. Until we stabilize the API and release version 1.0.0, we will use minor versions (i.e., x.Y.z) to introduce features and breaking features, and patch versions (i.e., x.y.Z) for bug fixes.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Griptape! Before you start, please read the following guidelines.

### Submitting Issues

If you have identified a bug, want to propose a new feature, or have a question, please submit an issue through our public [issue tracker](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/issues). Before submitting a new issue, please check the existing issues to ensure it hasn't been reported or discussed before.

### New Griptape Tools

Griptape's extensibility allows anyone to develop and distribute tools independently. With rare exceptions for tools providing broadly applicable functionality, new Griptape tools should be managed as their own projects and not submitted to the core framework. Pull requests for new tools (unless addressing an [existing issue](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/issues)) will be closed.

The [Griptape Tool Template](https://github.com/griptape-ai/tool-template) provides the recommended structure, step-by-step instructions, basic automation, and usage examples for new tools. In the Template, select **Use this template** then **Create a new repository** to begin a new tool project.

### Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome and encourage pull requests. To streamline the process, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Existing Issues:** Please submit pull requests only for existing issues. If you want to work on new functionality or fix a bug that hasn't been addressed yet, please first submit an issue. This allows the Griptape team to internally process the request and provide a public response.

2. **Branch:** Submit all pull requests to the `dev` branch. This helps us manage changes and integrate them smoothly.

3. **Unit Tests:** Ensure that your pull request passes all existing unit tests. Additionally, if you are introducing new code, please include new unit tests to validate its functionality.

4. **Documentation:** Every pull request must include a corresponding pull request in the [docs repository](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-docs) or explicitly explain why a documentation update is not required. Documentation is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive and user-friendly project.

5. **Code Style:** Griptape uses [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to enforce style guidelines. You can ensure that your code is formatted accordingly and will pass formatting checks using `pre-commit`. See [Tools](#tools) for information on how to configure this and other dev tools.

### Tools

Install dev dependencies with Poetry:

```shell
poetry install --all-extras --with dev --with test
```

Configure pre-commit to ensure that your code is formatted correctly and passes all checks:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```
