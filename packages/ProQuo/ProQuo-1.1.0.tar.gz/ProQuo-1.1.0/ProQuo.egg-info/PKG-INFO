              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Readme
`ProQuo` and `ProQuoLM` are a tools for the detection of short quotations (<= 4 words) between two texts, a source text and
a target text. The target text is the text quoting the source text. Quotations in the target text need to be clearly
marked with quotations marks. For more information, see below.

## Overview
The main purpose of this tool is to use the pretrained models for the detection of short quotations.
Both approaches, `ProQuo` and `ProQuoLM` are separate. In our evaluation (see citation below) we found both approaches
to perform at the same level while `ProQuoLm` is less complex as it is mainly a fine-tuned language model.
The library also supports training and testing of custom models for reference classification, relation classification
and linking classification.

**Note**: `ProQuoLM` is easier to use, faster, better documented, better maintained, better tested and the recommended
approach to use.

## Quotation marks
By default, the 'best', i.e. most common combination of opening and closing quotation mark in the specific text is used.
The following combinations are automatically tried:

1. " and "
2. „ and “
3. „ and "
4. “ and “
5. » and «
6. « and »
7. ‘ and ’

If this is not the desired behaviour, quotations marks can be manually defined, using the command line options
`--open-quote` and `--close-quote` to define which opening and closing quotation marks to use.

## Pretrained models and training data

The pretrained models and training data are made available and can be downloaded from [here](https://scm.cms.hu-berlin.de/schluesselstellen/proquodata).

For `ProQuoLm`, we also provide a model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Fredr0id/proquolm). This is used by default.

## Installation

### From PyPi

**Note**: Both tools are part of the same PyPi package. So the following command installs both.

~~~
pip install ProQuo
~~~

### From source
Checkout this repository and then run:

~~~
python -m pip install .
~~~

This installs `ProQuo` and all dependencies except `tensorflow` which needs to be installed manually depending on
the individual needs, see [Tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). The latest version that was
tested is 2.14.1.

For `RelationModelLstmTrainer`, `tensorflow-text` is needed. `RelationModelLstmTrainer` should normally not be needed as
`RelationModelBertTrainer` performs better and is the default in the pipeline.

## Usage
There are two ways to use the tool: in code and from the command line. Both are described in the following sections.

### Quotation detection
There are two approaches which can be used for quotation detection: A specialized pipeline and a general language model based approach.
To run the (recommended) language model approach with the default model, use the following command:

~~~
proquolm compare
path_to_source_text
path_to_target_text
--text
--output-type text
~~~

To run the specialized pipeline, use the following command:

~~~
proquo compare
path_to_source_text
path_to_target_text
path_to_the_reference_vocab_file
path_to_the_reference_model_file
path_to_the_relation_tokenizer_folder
path_to_the_relation_model_folder
--text
--output-type text
~~~

`--output-type text` prints the results to the command line. To save the results to a file, use `--output-type csv` or
`--output-type json`. `--text` includes the quotation text in the output.

The output will look something like this:
~~~
10	15	500	505	quote	quote
1000	1016	20	36	some other quote	some other quote
~~~
The first two numbers are the character start and end positions in the source text and the other two numbers are the
character start and end positions in the target text.

#### Note
There are a number of command line arguments to configure the output format, for example, to save the result to a csv
file. For all options, use the following commands:

~~~
proquo compare -h
~~~

~~~
proquolm compare -h
~~~

### Training and testing a model

#### Reference model
The following command can be used to train a reference model:

~~~
proquo train reference
path_to_train_set.txt
path_to_val_set.txt
path_to_the_output_folder
~~~

`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of two strings and a class,
tab separated, for example:

~~~
S. 47   S. 35	1
63	DKV III, 17	0
~~~

To test the model, run:

~~~
proquo test reference
path_to_test_set.txt
path_to_the_reference_vocab_file
path_to_the_reference_model_file
~~~

#### Relation model
The following command can be used to train a bert relation model:

~~~
proquo train relation
path_to_train_set.txt
path_to_val_set.txt
path_to_the_output_folder
--arch
"bert"
~~~

`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of a string and a class,
tab separated, for example:

~~~
some context, some text <Q> some quote </Q> ( <OREF> ). some more text ( <REF> )   0
~~~

To test the model, run:

~~~
proquo test relation bert
path_to_test_set.txt
path_to_the_tokenizer_folder
path_to_the_model_folder
~~~

#### Linking model
The following command can be used to train a linking model:

~~~
proquolm train
path_to_train_set.txt
path_to_val_set.txt
path_to_the_output_folder
~~~

`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of two strings and a class,
tab separated, for example:

~~~
some text for context, <S> candidate </S> some more text  start of second text, some context <T> candidate </T> text text text  0
~~~

To test the model, run:

~~~
proquolm test
path_to_test_set.txt
path_to_the_tokenizer_folder
path_to_the_model_folder
~~~
