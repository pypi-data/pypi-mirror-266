    Program : lsfbf4-9-2.f

          This is a program of data selection and curve fitting
       by a digital filtering technique including Reinsch-type cubic
       spline, Fourier harmonics and linear interpolation. It is to
       derive the fitted curve to the observed data ( CO2, d13C,..),
       as well as to separate the seasonal, short- and long-term
       variations from the data.

          The average seasonal cycle is represented by harmonics
       (NH=0-6), but if you give NH, the average cycle with NH+1 is
       first calculated and then smoothed by a Butterworth filter
       which attenuates signals with a period of NH+1 to 50 %.
          Linear interpolation is used to calculate equally spaced
       data from residuals which are obtained by extracting the
       average seasonal cycle from actual data.
          The long-term trend and irregular parts of the seasonal
       cycle are driven by smoothing equally spaced data ,obtained
       above, with the Butterworth filter.  The extrapolated data
       for the trend and overall fit are given by the fit to the
       actual data with a Reinsch spline (T5=1825days), which are
       altered by an iterative procedure.
          Prior to use of this program, the number of harmonics has
       to be determined by the program 'PERI'.  The digital filter
      form of Reinsch spline is shown explicitly by the programs
       'COX1' or 'COX' in which the transfer function is plotted.

          KD must be sufficiently larger than the value of ((910
       +2920)/(mean data interval expressed in day)+data number of
       the record). KO must be sufficiently larger than the value
       of (910+2920+length of the data record expressed in day).
       If you want to change KD, you must change KD of subroutine
       or function Fourier, Frc1, Reinsch, Setup, Chol1d, Smooth,
       Extrad1 and Judge1,too.  If you want to change KO, you must
       change N or KO in subroutines Bwf, Scycle, Yac and Judge1,
       too.

                                 By T. Nakazawa (Mar. 8, 1991)

    * Before digital filtering, data values with more than 3 standard
     errors of estimated fit are identified as outliers and rejected
     from further analysis. (dafault setting)

    * The order of Butterworth filter is set to be 26th for long-term
     and to be 16th for seasonal cycle. (dafault setting)
