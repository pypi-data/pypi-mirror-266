description = """
 This is a program of data selection and curve fitting \
 by a digital filtering technique including Reinsch-type cubic \
 spline, Fourier harmonics and linear interpolation. It is to \
 derive the fitted curve to the observed data ( CO2, d13C,..), \
 as well as to separate the seasonal, short- and long-term \
 variations from the data. \
