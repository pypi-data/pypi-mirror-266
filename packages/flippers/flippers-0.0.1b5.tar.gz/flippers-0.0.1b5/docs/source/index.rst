``flippers`` is built to be an alternative and improvement to the now archived ``Snorkel`` library with the following goals:

- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Fast and scalable.
- Better accuracy and calibration of the label model.
- Easy integratation with any machine learning pipeline.
- Strong documentation and support.
