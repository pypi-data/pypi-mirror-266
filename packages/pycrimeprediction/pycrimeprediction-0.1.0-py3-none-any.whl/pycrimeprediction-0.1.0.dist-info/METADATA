from pycrimeprediction.add_if_crime import add_if_crime_feature

input_path = "url-for-data.csv"
output_path = "saved-data-to-file.csv"

#Read data and split into examples and labels
df = read_save_data(input_path, output_path)
X = df.iloc[:, 0:-1]
y = df.iloc[:, -1]

#Print Cross-validation results for the Logistic Regression classifier
print(perform_analysis(X,y))
```
