# Pytector

Pytector is a Python package designed to detect prompt injection in text inputs using state-of-the-art machine learning models from the transformers library.

Pytector is still a prototype and cannot provide 100% protection against prompt injection attacks!

## Features

- Detect prompt injections with pre-trained models.
- Support for multiple models including DeBERTa, DistilBERT, and ONNX versions.
- Easy-to-use interface with customizable threshold settings.

## Installation
Via PIP
```bash
pip install pytector
```

Install Pytector directly from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaxMLang/pytector.git
cd pytector
pip install .
```



## Usage

To use Pytector, you can import the `PromptInjectionDetector` class and create an instance with a pre-defined model or a custom model URL.

```python
import pytector

# Initialize the detector with a pre-defined model
detector = pytector.PromptInjectionDetector(model_name_or_url="deberta")

# Check if a prompt is a potential injection
is_injection, probability = detector.detect_injection("Your suspicious prompt here")
print(f"Is injection: {is_injection}, Probability: {probability}")
```
