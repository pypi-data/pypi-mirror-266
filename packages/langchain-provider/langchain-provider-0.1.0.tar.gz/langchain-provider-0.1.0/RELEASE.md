# Release Procedure

In the commands below, replace `X.Y.Z` with the release version when needed.

**Note**: We use `pip` instead of `conda` here even on Conda installs, to ensure we always get the latest upstream versions of the build dependencies.


## PyPI

To release a new version of langchain-provider on PyPI:


### Prepare

  ```bash
  git restore . && git switch master && git pull upstream master
  ```

  ```


### Commit

* Install/upgrade Loghub

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade loghub
  ```

* Update `CHANGELOG.md` using Loghub to generate the list of issues and PRs merged to add at the top of the file

  ```bash
  loghub -m vX.Y.Z spyder-ide/langchain-provider
  ```

* Update `version` in `pyproject.toml` (set release version, remove `.dev0`)

  ```


### Release
