# Financial Datasets ðŸ§ª

Financial Datasets is an open-source Python library 
that allows developers to create synthetic financial datasets
using Large Language Models (LLMs). With this library,
you can generate realistic financial datasets based on SEC filings
such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other financial reports.

## Features

- Generate synthetic financial datasets using LLMs
- Supports various SEC filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs, etc.)
- Easy integration with Python projects
- Customizable data generation options

## Usage

**Example code:**
```python
from financial_datasets.generator import DatasetGenerator

texts = ...  # List of texts from SEC filing
generator = DatasetGenerator(
   model="gpt-4-0125-preview",
   api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
)
dataset = generator.generate_from_texts(texts, max_questions=100)
```

**Example generated dataset:**
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What was Airbnb's revenue in 2023?",
    "answer": "$9.9 billion",
    "context": "In 2023, revenue increased by 18% to $9.9 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to a 14% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 54.5 million combined with higher average daily rates driving a 16% increase in Gross Booking Value of $10.0 billion."
  },
  {
    "question": "By what percentage did Airbnb's net income increase in 2023 compared to the prior year?",
    "answer": "153%",
    "context": "Net income in 2023 increased by 153% to $4.8 billion, compared to the prior year, driven by our revenue growth, increased interest income, discipline in managing our cost structure, and the release of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion."
  }
]
```
