# Getting Started

## Introduction

This tutorial will give a full introduction to starting
a neuroscience project with **datashuttle**.

We will get an overview of  **datashuttle**'s key features by creating
and transferring a 'mock' experiment, standardised to the
[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/) style.

```
<br>

We will create standardised folders then upload mock 'acquired' data (empty text files)
to a central data storage, as you would do in a real data acquisition session.
Then we will download a subset of data (e.g. test sessions only) from the central
storage, as you would do during analysis.

## Installing **datashuttle**

The first step is to install **datashuttle**, by following the instructions
on the [How to Install](how-to-install) page.


::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

Once **datashuttle** is installed,  typing `datashuttle launch` will
launch the application in your terminal

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-landing-screen-dark.png

   :class: only-light
   :width: 700px
```

:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

We can check **datashuttle** has installed correctly by
by importing it into Python without error

```python
from datashuttle import DataShuttle
```

:::
::::

## Make a new project

The first thing to do when using **datashuttle** on a new machine is
to set up your project.

We need to tell **datashuttle** the:

1) project name
2) location of the project our local machine, where we will save acquired data
3) location of the central data storage, where we will upload the acquired data

**datashuttle** supports central data storage either mounted as a drive
on the local machine or through an SHH connection.
See [How to Make a New Project](make-a-new-project) for detailed instructions for
connecting a mounted drive or SSH connection.

In this walkthrough, we will set our central storage as a
folder on our machine for simplicity.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

Now we will set up a new project. Click `Make New Project` and you
will be taken to the project setup page.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-screen-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 900px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-screen-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 900px
```
<br>

We'll call our project `my_first_project`, and can type this into
the first input box on the page.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-project-name-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-project-name-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Next we need to specify the _local path_, the location on our machine where
we will save our acquired data. Choose any directory that is
convenient, and then add `local` to the end of the filepath.
The filepath can be typed into the input, copied in with `CTRL+V`
or selected from a directory tree using the `Select` button.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-local-path-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-local-path-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Finally, we need to  select the _central path_. Usually this would be
a path to a mounted central storage drive or relative to the server path
if connecting via SSH. In this tutorial, we will
set this next to the _local path_ for convenience:

1) Copy the contents of the _local path_ input by clicking it, hovering over it and pressing `CTRL+Q` to copy.
2) Paste it into the _central path_ input with `CTRL+V` and change 'local' to 'central'.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-central-path-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-make-central-path-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

You can now click `Save` to set up the project. Once the project
is created, the `Go to Project Screen` button will appear.
Click to move on to the `Create Project` page.

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

First, we can initialise **datashuttle**
with our chosen `project_name`. In this tutorial we will call
our project `my_first_project` and instantiate the `DataShuttle`
class with this name

```python
project = DataShuttle("my_first_project")
```

The created `project` object has many methods for interacting with
**datashuttle**. Next, we will use the `make_config_file()` method to set up the configurations
('configs') for our project.

While full details of all available configs can be found on the
[How to Make a New Project](make-a-new-project)
page, here we will focus on the main three: the `local_path`, `central_path`
and the `connection_method`.

We will specify the `local_path` as the location on our machine where we
will place our project and save the acquired data.

Usually `central_path` would be the path to a mounted
central storage drive or a relative server path
if connecting via SSH. In this tutorial, we will
set this next to the _local path_ for convenience.

Finally, we  will set the `connection_method` to `"local_filesystem"`
as we are not using SSH.

```python
project.make_config_file(
    local_path=r"C:\Users\Joe\data\local\my_first_project",
    central_path=r"C:\Users\Joe\data\central\my_first_project",
    connection_method="local_filesystem",
)
```

If you want to change any config in the future, use the `update_config_file` method

```python
project.update_config_file(
    local_path=r"C:\a\new\path"
)
```

Now the project is set up, we are ready to create our standardised project folders!
:::
::::
## Creating folders

Let's imagine today is our first day of data collection,
and we are acquiring  behaviour (`behav`) and electrophysiology (`ephys`) data.
We will create standardised subject, session and datatype folders
to put the acquired data into.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

We will create standardised project folders using the `Create` tab.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-screen-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 900px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-screen-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 900px
```
<br>

Following the [NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/)
style we will  call the first subject `sub-001`. Additional key-value pairs in
the subject name could be included if desired (see the
[NeuroBlueprint specification](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/specification.html)
for more details).

In the session name we can include today's date,
so our first session will be `ses-001_date-<todays_date>`.

We could start by typing `sub-001` into the subject input box, but
it is more convenient to simply double-left-click it. This will suggest
the next subject number based on the current subjects in the project.
As currently this project is empty, the suggested next subject is `sub-001`.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-subject-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-subject-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

```{note}
The subject and session folder input boxes have live validation.
This will flag any
[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/)
errors with a red border. Hover over the input box with the mouse
to see the nature of the error.
```

Next, we can input the session name. Double-left-click on the session
input to automatically fill with `ses-001`. We can then add
today's date with the `@DATE@` convenience tag.

When the session folder is created, today's date will be automatically added.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-session-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-session-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Next, uncheck the `funcimg` and `anat` datatype boxes, to ensure
we only create `behav` and `ephys` folders in our session folder.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-datatype-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-create-datatype-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Finally, click `Create Folders` to create the folder structure in the project!

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python
We will create standardised project folders with the `create_folders()` method.

Following the [NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/)
style we will call the first subject `sub-001`. Additional key-value pairs in
the subject name could be included if desired (see the
[NeuroBlueprint specification](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/specification.html)
for more details).

In the session name we can include todayâ€™s date, so our first session will
be `ses-001_date-<todays_date>`. We can use the `@DATE@` convenience tag.

Finally, we will tell **datashuttle** to create `behav` and `ephys` datatype
folders only.

```python
project.create_folders(
    top_level_folder="rawdata",
    sub_names="sub-001",
    ses_names="ses-001_@DATE@",
    datatype=["behav", "ephys"]
)
```

Navigating to the `central_path` in your system filebrowser, you will
see the transferred files.

```{note}
The names of the folders to be created are validated on the fly against
[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/specification.html).
If the folder names will break with the specification, an error will be
raised and the folders will not be created.
```

Two useful methods to automate folder creation are `get_next_sub_number()` and
`get_next_ses_number()`. These can be used to automatically get the next subject
and session names in a project.

For example, to get the next subject
in this project (`sub-002`) and the next session for that subject (in this case,
as it is the first session for `sub-002`, it will be `ses-001`) we can run

```python
next_sub = project.get_next_sub_number("rawdata", local_only=True)                # returns "sub-001"
next_ses = project.get_next_ses_number("rawdata", sub=next_sub, local_only=True)  # returns "ses-001"

project.create_folders(
    "rawdata",
    next_sub,
    f"{next_ses}_@DATE@",
    datatype=["behav", "ephys"]
)
```

This will create the folders, with today's date included in the session folder name.
The `local_only` argument restricts the search for the next subject and session
to the local project folder only. To also consider subjects and sessions in
the central storage, set this to `False`.

:::
::::

This was a quick overview of the creating foldersâ€”see [How to use Name Templates](how-to-use-name-templates)
and [How to use Create Folder Tags](how-to-create-folders2) for more detail on validation and convenience tags.

## Exploring folders

In our imagined experiment, we will next want to save data from
acquisition software into our newly created, standardised folders.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

When folders are created, the `Directory Tree` on the left-hand side
will update to display the new folders.
By hovering over a folder on the `Directory Tree` we can quickly
copy the full path to the folder (`CTRL+Q)`) (you may need to click
the `Directory Tree` first).

Alternatively, pressing `CTRL+O` will open the folder in your file browser.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-explore-folders-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-explore-folders-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

These shortcuts aim to make it simple to direct your acquisition software
to the datatype folders. Hover over the `DirectoryTree`
for a tooltip indicating all possible shortcuts.

```{admonition} Creating mock data for the tutorial

To continue with our experiment, we will need to create 'mock'
acquired data to transfer to central storage. These will
take the form of simple text files with their extensions changed.

You can download these files from
[this link](https://gin.g-node.org/joe-ziminski/datashuttle/src/master/docs/tutorial-mock-data-files),
by right-clicking each file and selecting 'Download (or) Save Link As..'.
Alternatively you can create them in your favourite text editor.

Next, hover over the `behav` folder the `Directory Tree` with your
mouse and and press `CTRL+O` to open the folder in your file browser.
Move the mock behavioural data file (`sub-001_ses-001_camera-top.mp4`)
into the `behav` datatype folder.

Next, repeat this for the `ephys` datatype by moving the remaining
electrophysiology files to the `ephys` folder.

Finally, hover the mouse over the `Directory Tree` and press `CTRL+R` to refresh.

```

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

`create_folders()` returns the full filepaths of created datatype folders.
These can be used to save data to these folders in acquisition scripts

```python
folder_path_list = project.create_folders(
    top_level_folder="rawdata",
    sub_names=["sub-001"],
    ses_names=["ses-001_@DATE@"],
    datatype=["behav", "ephys"]

)

print([path_ for path_ in folder_path_list if path_.name == "behav"])
# ["C:\Users\Joe\data\local\my_first_project\sub-001\ses-001_16052024\behav"]
```


```{admonition} Creating mock data for the tutorial

To continue with our experiment, we will need to create 'mock'
acquired data to transfer to central storage. These will
take the form of simple text files with their extensions changed.

You can download these files from
[this link](https://gin.g-node.org/joe-ziminski/datashuttle/src/master/docs/tutorial-mock-data-files),
by right-clicking each file and selecting 'Download (or) Save Link As..'.
Alternatively you can create them in your favourite text editor.

Move the mock behavioural data file (`sub-001_ses-001_camera-top.mp4`)
into the `behav` datatype folder and the remaining
electrophysiology file to the `ephys` folder.

```
:::
::::

## Uploading to central storage

We have now 'acquired' `behav` and `ephys` data onto our local machine.
The next step is to upload it to central data storage.

Typically,  this would be an external machine or server, connected through a mounted
drive or via SSH. In this walkthrough, we set the central storage on our
local machine for convenience.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

First, switch to the `Transfer` tab, where on the left we will again
see a `Directory Tree` displaying the local version of the project.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-upload-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 900px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-upload-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 900px
```
<br>

The first page on the `Transfer` tab allows us to upload the entire project,
both the `rawdata` and `derivatives` top-level folders
(the `derivatives` folder is used for outputs of processing `rawdata`, see the
[NeuroBlueprint specification](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/specification.html)).

As we only have a `rawdata` folder, we can simply click `Transfer` to
upload everything to central storage.

Navigating to the _central path_ in the file browser,
the newly transferred data will have appeared, simulating transfer
to a separate data storage machine. (An easy way to navigate to the *central path*
is to go to the `Config` tab and press `CTRL+O` on the _central path_ input box).

We can also click the `Top Level`
or `Custom` buttons for refined transfers (for example, if we also had a
`derivatives` folder we did not want to upload). For more information
see the [How to Transfer Data](how-to-transfer-data) page as well as
and the next tutorial section for `Custom` transfers.

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

`upload_entire_project()` is a high level method that uploads all files
in the project. This includes both `rawdata` and `derivatives` top-level folders
(the `derivatives` folder is used for outputs of processing `rawdata`, see the
[NeuroBlueprint specification](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/specification.html)).

As we only have a `rawdata` folder, we can simply run

```python
project.upload_entire_project()
```

and all files will be uploaded from the local version of the project to central storage.

Navigating to the `central_path` in your systems file browser, the newly transferred data
will have appeared, simulating transfer to a separate data storage machine.

Other methods (`upload_all()` and `upload()`) provide refined
data transfers (and every `upload` method has an equivalent `download` method).
For more information  see the
[How to Transfer Data](how-to-transfer-data) page
as well as the next tutorial section for customisable transfers.

Note that the `overwrite_existing_files` config controls whether
transferred data will overwrite data on the target machine. This config
can be set initially  with `make_config_file` or updated with with
`update_config_file`

```python
project.update_config_file(
  overwrite_existing_files=True,
)
```

:::
::::

```{warning}
The `Overwrite Existing Files` setting is very important.
By default it is turned off and a transfer will never overwrite a
file that already exists, even if the source version is newer.

For example, if we upload the first session's behavioural dataâ€”and there
is already a file on central storage with the same name
in the same folderâ€”the file will not be uploaded.

If `Overwrite Existing Files` is on, then any existing files
will be overwritten by newer versions of the file during transfer.
```

With the data safely on our central storage,
our experimental acquisition session is complete!


## Downloading from central storage

Next let's imagine we are on a different, analysis machine and want to
download a subset of data for further processing.

In this example we will download the behavioural data only from the first session.
In practice **datashuttle**'s custom data transfers work well when there
are many subjects and sessions (for example, downloading only the behavioural
'test' sessions from a specific range of subjects).

```{admonition} Replicating a fresh machine for the tutorial
To replicate starting on a new local machine, delete the `rawdata` folder from
your _local_ path.

We will next download data from the central project to our now-empty local project.
In practice when setting up **datashuttle** on a new machine, you would
again [Make a new project](make-a-new-project).
```

We will look at a small subset of possible
options here, but see [How to make Custom Transfers](making-custom-transfers) for more possibilities.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Graphical Interface
:sync: gui

The `Custom` transfer screen has options for selecting specific combinations
of subjects, sessions and datatypes.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 600px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 600px
```
<br>

In the subject input, we can simply type `all` (in this case, we only have one subject anyway).

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-subjects-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-subjects-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Next, let's specify what session to download. We can use the
[wildcard tag](transfer-the-wildcard-tag)
to avoid typing the exact dateâ€”`ses-001_@*@`.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-sessions-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-sessions-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Then, select only the `behav` datatype from the datatype checkboxes.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-datatypes-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-datatypes-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

Finally, we can select `Download` from the upload / download switch,
and click `Transfer`.

Note that the `Overwrite Existing Files` setting affects both upload
and downloadsâ€”any local versions of a file will be overwritten
by newer versions downloaded from central storage when it is turned on.

```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-switch-dark.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-dark
   :width: 400px
```
```{image} /_static/screenshots/tutorial-1-transfer-screen-custom-switch-light.png
   :align: center
   :class: only-light
   :width: 400px
```
<br>

The transfer will complete, and the custom selection
of files will now be available in the _local path_ folder.

:::
:::{tab-item} Python API
:sync: python

We can use the `download()` method (the download equivalent method of
the `upload()`).

We will download only the behavioural data from the first
session, using a few shortcuts available for custom transfers

```python
project.download(
    top_level_folder="rawdata",
    sub_names="all",
    ses_names="ses-001_@*@",
    datatype="behav"
)
```

The `"all"` keyword will upload every subject in the project (in this case,
we only have one subject anyway).

The `@*@` [wildcard tag](transfer-the-wildcard-tag) can be used to match
any part of a subject or session nameâ€”in this case we use it to avoid
typing out the date.

Finally, we chose to download only the `behav` data for the session.
:::
::::

```{note}
Detailed information on data transfers can be found in the `Logs`.
Visit [How to Read the Logs](how-to-read-the-logs) for more information.
```

The transfer will complete, and the custom selection
of files will now be available in the _local path_ folder!

## Summary

That final transfer marks the end of our **datashuttle** tutorial!

Now you can:

1) set up a new project
2) upload your acquired data to a central storage machine
3) download subsets of data for analysis
