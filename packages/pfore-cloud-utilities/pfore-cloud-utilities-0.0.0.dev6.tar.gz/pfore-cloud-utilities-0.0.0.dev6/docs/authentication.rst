Authentication
==============

:class:`pfore_cloud_utilities.AADTokenGenerator` and
:class:`pfore_cloud_utilities.AzureBlobConnector` requires authentication
to function properly. The authentication can be done either using
a managed identity (case you're running the package form an Azure Kubernetes
cluster or whatever resource that supports Azure Managed Identities),
or can be done using Service Principals. Authentication using personal account
isn't recommended for security purposes and therefore wasn't implemented.

To authenticate with a Managed Identity, simply call the class and its methods,
no further configuration is required.
To authenticate using SPNs, you can either hard-code them upon classes
instantiation (highly discouraged), use env variables (also discouraged) or
fetch them securely from a keyvault. To see how to fetch credentials securely,
