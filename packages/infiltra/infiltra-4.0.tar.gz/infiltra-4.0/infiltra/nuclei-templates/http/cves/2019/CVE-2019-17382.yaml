  name: Zabbix <=4.4 - Authentication Bypass
  author: harshbothra_
  severity: critical
  description: Zabbix through 4.4 is susceptible to an authentication bypass vulnerability via zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1. An attacker can bypass the login page and access the dashboard page, and then create a Dashboard, Report, Screen, or Map without any Username/Password (i.e., anonymously). All created elements (Dashboard/Report/Screen/Map) are accessible by other users and by an admin.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Zabbix application.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to a patched version of Zabbix (>=4.4) to mitigate this vulnerability.
