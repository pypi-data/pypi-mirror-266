# SystemsLink Energy Manager Data Scraper

This project aims to provide a Python library capable of retrieving data from an instance of SystemsLink Energy Manager.

> ⚠️ Please note: To my knowledge, the SystemsLink energy monitoring platform does not offer any public APIs from which data can be retrieved. Instead, this system will step through the standard authentication and requests procedure as would be used by a normal user accessing the webpage.
