SL_C0de
=======

**SL_C0de** (/lu'make/) is a python library based on the matlab code SL_code. This module allows to calculate GIA over the world but also the sediment isostasy. It includes function to calculate radial symetric auto gravitational earth visco-elastic response. This module also includes the option to resolve the Sea level equation. This library has been benchmarked with the following Matlab code (jaustermann/SLcode/tree/master/GRL_2022_proglacial_lakes).The aim of this library is to be easy to include new sources of load and can be linked to other python library.
