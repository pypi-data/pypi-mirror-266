## What does it do?

This script is recommended if you would like to do conversion, linkage analysis, similarity scoring, and gene-disease recommendation based on the phenotype data provided at [clinical_data.txt](clinical_data.txt). Full feature : 
1. Convert the phenotype data to HPO code (accept mixed SNOMED, LOINC, and HPO code)
2. Similarity scoring of differential diagnosis
3. Linkage analysis of differential diagnosis (accept mixed SNOMED, ICD-10, ORPHA, OMIM code), include dendrogram tree visualization.
    - This should help clinician to **systematically doing work-up and excluding similar diagnosis together** based on the patient\'s phenotype.
4. Gene and disease recommendation based on the phenotype data similarity scoring between **phenotype** and OMIM gene and disease databank.
5. Linkage analysis of recommended causative gene and disease based on phenotype data (include dendrogram tree visualization).
    - This should help clinician to **explore / enrich their differential diagnosis** based on the patient\'s phenotype.
6. Example of the clinical data provided at [Clinical Information Example section](#clinical-information-example)
