OBX|1|TX|||The liver has normal dimensions and a relatively regular outline, with a slight heterogeneity of its structure, however without relevant focal lesions, in addition to few minute focal hypodensities, namely in the left lobe, which is difficult to assess due to its reduced size, and may only correspond to incipient cystic formations.\X0A\There is no dilatation of the bile ducts or appreciable thickening of the gallbladder wall. The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands do not suggest significant changes, as do the kidneys, which eliminate the contrast product freely and practically symmetrically. Bordering the hilar vessels of the right kidney, a pericentimetric annular calcification is defined, which apparently reflects a small saccular aneurysm. There is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or free or collected intraperitoneal fluid. A relative parietal prominence in the distal region of the duodenum is outlined, with imprecise limits and difficult to assess, namely due to the scarce luminal distension, proposing a correlation with possible previous studies, to which we did not have access. There are no signs of invasion by continuity of adjacent structures, sketching one or another infracentimetric satellite ganglion. The bladder retains a relatively thin and regular wall. The prostate appears to be globular, with no explicit irregularity of the capsular contour. Finally, reference is made to signs of previous hip fracture, with the presence of osteosynthesis material in the right femur.||||||F
