This notebook was created to demo my open-source sparse autoencoder visualizer, as can be seen [here](https://www.perfectlynormal.co.uk/blog-sae). Other useful links:

* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/sae_vis)
* [Developer guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ctbiIskkkDc5eztqgADlvTufs7uzx5Wj8FE_y5petk/edit#heading=h.t3sp1uj6qghd), for people looking to understand the codebase so they can contribute
* [User guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGjDB3iFJ5Y0GGpTwibUVsvpnzctRSHRLI-0rm6wt_k/edit#heading=h.t3sp1uj6qghd), for people looking to understand how to use all the features of this codebase (although obviously reading through this notebook is another option, it should be mostly self-explanatory)

Version history (started to record at 0.2.9)

* `0.2.9` - added table for pairwise feature correlations (not just encoder-B correlations)
