    Glue function for high-performance timer. Calls the windows performance counter and frequency through C-bindings.
    Note that these functions are not available on all platforms, and require that the processor's time-stamp counter
    is invariant across cores and threads, as well as invariant through boosting and changes in power-state. The vast
    majority of modern processors satisfy these requirements, and in the even they do not, modern windows versions
    (i.e., Windows 8/10/11) will automatically fal-lback to an invariant clock. This fal-lback clock is not as
    high-performance and high-resolution as the query performance counter, so you will end up with considerable larger
    intervals between timestamps and less precision in timing. While these effects are not relevant in most
    applications, it becomes very relevant in real-time systems like neurobeam.
