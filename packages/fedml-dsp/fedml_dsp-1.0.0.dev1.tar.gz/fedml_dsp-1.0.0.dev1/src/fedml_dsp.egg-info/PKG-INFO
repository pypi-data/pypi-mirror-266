## Introduction

The SAP Federated ML Python libraries (FedML) applies the Data Federation architecture of SAP Datasphere for intelligently sourcing SAP as well as non-SAP data for Machine Learning experiments done at any Machine Learning platform thereby removing the need for replicating or moving data. By abstracting the Data Connection and Data load , the FedML library provides end to end platform agnostic integration support for instant data access & discovery of semantically rich business data with just few lines of code.

## Installation

Install the SAP FedML library using pip as follows:

`pip install fedml-dsp`

## Documentation and getting started
