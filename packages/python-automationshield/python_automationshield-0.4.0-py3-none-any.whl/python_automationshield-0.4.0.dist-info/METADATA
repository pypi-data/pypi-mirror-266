# python-automationshield

`python-automationshield` is a Python package that implements a Python interface to [Automationshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield)'s devices. Automationshield creates cheap and accessible tools for control engineering education in the form of Arduino shields. Currently, this package has Python implementations for the following shields:

- [Aeroshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/AeroShield)
- [Floatshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/FloatShield)
- [Magnetoshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/MagnetoShield)

This project was built to allow TU Delft students learning control engineering to use Python in their assignments, since that is what they are thought in the curriculum. This package provides a flexible controller class that lets users conveniently implement a controller and run it on the Arduino hardware.

## Installation

`python-automationshield` requires Python >= 3.10 and can be installed with the following command:

```bash
$ pip install python-automationshield
```

## Usage

<!-- - TODO: basic basic example, live plot visuals. link to examples -->
Below is a very simple example with the AeroShield to get started. Read more in the [documentation](https://python-automationshield.readthedocs.io).

Use the `AeroShield` class to interface directly with the Arduino.

```python
from automationshield import AeroShield


with AeroShield() as aero_shield:
    for _ in range(100):
        aero_shield.write(flag=aero_shield.RUN, motor=50)
        out = aero_shield.read()
        print(f"Potentiomneter [%]: {out[0]}, Angle [°]: {out[1]}")
```

Use the `ShieldController` class to conveniently implement a controller.

```python
from automationshield import AeroShield, ShieldController


class MyController(ShieldController):
    def controller(self, t: float, dt: float, ref: float, pot: float, angle: float) -> float:
        """Set the motor value to the provided reference."""
        return ref

# create controller instance
my_controller = MyController(AeroShield())
# run the controller on the Arduino.
hist = my_controller.run(freq=200, cycles=1000, ref=45)
```

Plot the experiment data using the `plotting.Plotter` class

```python
from automationshield.plotting import Plotter


fig, ax = Plotter.plot(hist)
fig.show()
```

Below is an example of a figure plotting the result of a PID controller with a constant reference at 45°.
