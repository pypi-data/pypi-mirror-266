YoWASP WaveDrom package
=======================

This package provides a self-contained [WaveDrom] renderer for JavaScript and Python applications. See the [overview of the YoWASP project][yowasp] for details.

[WaveDrom]: https://wavedrom.com/
[yowasp]: https://yowasp.org/

Command-line tool
-----------------

This package installs a command-line tool `yowasp-wavedrom`.

```
Usage: yowasp-wavedrom [<input.json>] [<output.svg>]
```

API reference (JavaScript)
--------------------------

The [@yowasp/wavedrom] package has one entry point, `render(source): string`. It accepts a JavaScript object in the WaveJSON format and returns an SVG image serialized as a string:

```js
import { render } from '@yowasp/wavedrom';

console.log(render({signal: [{ name: "clk", wave: "p..." }, { name: "data", wave: "01.0" }]}));
// => <svg.../svg>
```

[@yowasp/wavedrom]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yowasp/wavedrom

API reference (Python)
----------------------

The [yowasp-wavedrom] package has one entry point, `render(source) -> str`. It accepts a Python dictionary in the WaveJSON format and returns an SVG image serialized as a string:

```py
from yowasp_wavedrom import render

print(render({"signal": [{ "name": "clk", "wave": "p..." }, { "name": "data", "wave": "01.0" }]}))
# => <svg.../svg>
```

Implementation notes
--------------------

This package embeds the [upstream WaveDrom library][upstream] bundled with the minimal amount of dependencies necessary to produce a serialized SVG, and, for the Python package, with a JavaScript runtime. In addition, the output is post-processed compared to the upstream library as follows:

* The `id` attribute of the root `<svg>` element is removed.
* The stylesheets are altered to take into account dark color scheme preference via media queries.
    * By default, the diagrams automatically switch between light and dark color schemes based on the user preference. The light variant is the default upstream WaveDrom color scheme, and the dark variant is the same but with colors inverted. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use media queries to switch between the default/light skin and the dark skin for waveform diagrams, and an inversion filter is used instead.
* Several otherwise blocking bugs are worked around.

Updates
-------

Unlike most [YoWASP] packages, this package does not automatically track upstream releases. Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/YoWASP/wavedrom/pulls) bumping the version of `wavedrom` in `package-in.json` if you need a feature from a newer version of [WaveDrom].
