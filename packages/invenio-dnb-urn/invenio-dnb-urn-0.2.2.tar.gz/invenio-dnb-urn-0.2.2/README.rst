DNB support module for InvenioRDM. It offers a URN PIDProvider and additional metadata formats to be included
in the OAI-PMH server. Currently these are epicur and xMetaDissPlus.
In a later step the epicur format will be replaced by extending the URN PIDProvider by accessing the
DNB REST-APIs to directly mint new and changed URN's.

Please follow the instructions on https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/ for configuration and installation.
