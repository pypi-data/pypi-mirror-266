# these should get passed through LaunchTools
standard: # make mp if comparing to MP data

fun: # usually this is fine
lobster_static: False # can make False if you don't want to run LOBSTER
perturb_struc: False # if float, perturb internal ionic coordinates by perturb_struc

bs_symprec: 0.1 # symprec for generating primitive cell for bs calculation
bs_line_density: 20 # kpoint line density for bs calculation
generate_parchg: False # if True, generate a partial charge
eint_for_parchg: -1 # the lower energy (relative to E_Fermi) that you want to analyze
generate_dielectric: False # if True, prepare the INCAR for the static calculation to generate the dielectric tensor

generate_finite_displacements: False # if True, run finite displacements

# may be desirable to pass various configs for each type of calculation
# INCARs should be {INCAR_FLAG : value}
# KPOINTs should be Kpoints object
# POTCARs should be {el (str) : potcar flag (str)}
