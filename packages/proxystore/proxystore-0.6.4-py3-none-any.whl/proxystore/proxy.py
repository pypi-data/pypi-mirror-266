    """Lazy Object Proxy.

    An extension of the Proxy from
    [lazy-object-proxy](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy){target=_blank}
    with modified pickling behavior.

    An object proxy acts as a thin wrapper around a Python object, i.e.
    the proxy behaves identically to the underlying object. The proxy is
    initialized with a callable factory object. The factory returns the
    underlying object when called, i.e. 'resolves' the proxy. The does
    just-in-time resolution, i.e., the proxy
    does not call the factory until the first access to the proxy (hence, the
    lazy aspect of the proxy).

    The factory contains the mechanisms to appropriately resolve the object,
    e.g., which in the case for ProxyStore means requesting the correct
    object from the backend store.

    ```python
    x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    f = ps.factory.SimpleFactory(x)
    p = ps.proxy.Proxy(f)
    assert isinstance(p, np.ndarray)
    assert np.array_equal(p, [1, 2, 3])
    ```

    Note:
        The `factory`, by default, is only ever called once during the
        lifetime of a proxy instance.

    Note:
        When a proxy instance is pickled, only the `factory` is pickled, not
        the wrapped object. Thus, proxy instances can be pickled and passed
        around cheaply, and once the proxy is unpickled and used, the `factory`
        will be called again to resolve the object.

    Warning:
        A proxy of a singleton type (e.g., `True`, `False`, and `None`) will
        not behave exactly as a singleton type would. This is because the
        proxy itself is not a singleton.

        ```python
        >>> from proxystore.proxy import Proxy
        >>> p = Proxy(lambda: True)
        >>> p == True
        True
        >>> p is True
        False
        ```

    Warning:
        Python bindings to other languages (e.g., C, C++) may throw type
        errors when receiving a [`Proxy`][proxystore.proxy.Proxy] instance.
        Casting the proxy or extracting the target object may be needed.

        ```python
        >>> import io
        >>> from proxystore.proxy import Proxy
        >>> s = 'mystring'
        >>> p = Proxy(lambda: s)
